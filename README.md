After reviewing monthly report data from Citi Bike NYC, I decided to complete my analysis comparing the snapshot of the most recent month recorded (May 2023), and comparing the changes in usage from the same month in the previous year (May 2022). 

Some data cleaning was required, and I opted to consider only trips with a start and end time as 'valid' trips to be included in the data, dropping rides without both start and end times. I combined both years' data into one file to complete visualizations in Tableau and draw conclusions based on my findings.

Due to the size of the raw data files, they cannot be uploaded to GitHub, but instead could be accessed here if you'd like to review: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html
  
  file names:  202305-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip,
  202205-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip 

Please feel free to review my findings in the public Tableau reports linked below:
